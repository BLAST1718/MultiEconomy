## Commands

| /addtobalance \<player> \<currency> \<amount> | /addtobal | Add to a players balance | multieconomy.addtobalance |
| /balance [player/currency] [currency]  | /bal | Check yours or another players balance | None |

## Languages
MultiEconomy has a language system, the list below are implemented languages and their 3 digit code
 - English: ``eng``
> Create a Pull Request with the language name, and a proper translation of ``eng.yml`` to request another language
 
## API
MultiEconomy has a built in API, so you can interrogate MultiEconomy with your own plugins
To get the API class, you have to use ``PluginManager::getPlugin()`` to get an instance of MultiEconomy's main class.
```php
/** @var PluginBase $this */
$plugin = $this->getServer()->getPluginManager()->getPlugin("MultiEconomy");
```
Now you have an instance of the main class, you can use the ``getAPI()`` function
```php
$api = $plugin->getAPI();
```  
To create a new currency in order to register it, you can do the following:
```php
$name = "Dollars"; // Currency name
$symbol = "$"; // Symbol for currency amounts 
$symbolAfter = false; // Wether the symbol comes before or after the amount
$startingAmount = 0; // The amount a player starts on when they first get a balance
$minAmount = 0; // Minimum amount a player can have in the currency
$maxAmount = 999999; // Maximum amount a player can have in the currency
$currency = new Twisted\MultiEconomy\Currency($name, $symbol, $symbolAfter, $startingAmount, $minAmount, $maxAmount);
```
