## Languages
MultiEconomy has a language system, the list below are implemented languages and their 3 digit code
 - English: ``eng``
> Create a Pull Request with the language name, and a proper translation of ``eng.yml`` to request another language
 
## API
MultiEconomy has a built in API, so you can interrogate MultiEconomy with your own plugins
To get the API class, you have to use ``PluginManager::getPlugin()`` to get an instance of MultiEconomy's main class.
```php
$plugin = pocketmine\Server::getInstance()->getPluginManager()->getPlugin("MultiEconomy");
```
Now you have an instance of the main class, you can use the ``getAPI()`` function
```php
$api = $plugin->getAPI();
```
